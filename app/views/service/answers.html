          <h3>Two H1 tags</h3>
          <p>It is good practice to have only one <code>H1</code> tag on a page. The <code>H1</code> is the most important heading and tells you what the purpose of the overall page is. Screen reader users can use headers to navigate a page by skipping to them so having a good heading structure helps.</p>

          <h3>'NHS number' link not underlined</h3>
          <p>Users may not perceive colour differences so would not identify this as a link. Links should be underlined or have some other non-colour visual distinction.</p>

          <h3>'Mental health services' link opens in new tab</h3>
          <p>Opening a new tab (or window) when a link is activated can be disorienting for some users if they are not warned in advance. Users may be unaware that it has happened and won't be able to use the back button as there is no history in the new tab.</p>

          <h4>Techniques for opening new tabs or windows</h4>

      <h2>What is your name?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-8">
          <h3>First name label not associated with the input field</h3>
          <p>The label tag is missing a 'for' attribute and the input field is missing the associated 'id' attribute. This means the function or purpose of the input field may not be presented to screen reader users. Form labels also provide visible descriptions and provides a larger clickable area for the input field, since clicking on the label will activate it and bring it to focus. This can be helpful for users with impaired motor control.</p>

          <h4>Understanding WCAG regarding form labels and inputs</h4>

        <li class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-8">
          <h3>Visually hidden item you can tab onto</h3>
          <p>There is a visually hidden input field that can be tabbed to. This might be required for example to pass data between pages. Although the input field is hidden off screen, it still receives focus. This could confuse keyboard users who are tabbing through the page because the focus would disappear.</p>

          <h4>Understanding WCAG regarding focus</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/on-focus.html">3.2.1: On Focus</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h2>What is your date of birth?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-8">
          <h3>Wrong page title</h3>
          <p>Some screen readers (like JAWS) read the page title when a page loads. This page title is 'What is your name? - Register for our new service' which is incorrect as it should relate to what the page subject is, which in this case is asking what your date of birth is. The page title is the same as the previous page and has not been changed.</p>

          <h4>Understanding WCAG regarding page titles</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/page-titled.html">2.4.2: Page Titled</a></li>
          </ul>

        </li>
        <li class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-8">
          <h3>No legend element</h3>
          <p>We can visually tell that the input fields relate to the main heading by looking at the page. But, the question isn't linked up to the element in a way that makes sense for users who can't see. For radio buttons and checkboxes, it's important to have a legend element. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The inputs are marked up in a table element</h3>
          <p>Use the table element for tabular data and not for layout puurposes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Continue button not keyboard focusable</h3>
          <p>You can still get past this page by pressing enter when on the radio buttons, but a user might not know this. They might (understandably) expect that the only way to progress is by submitting enter, and so feel trapped and abandon the service at this point. All interactive elements must be usabled with the keyboard. The fix would be removing the tabindex="-1"</p>
