# Introduction

This is a fictional NHS service website that can be used for accessibility training.

It uses the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system">NHS design system</a> which is based on the research and experience of many NHS digital teams and adheres to accessibility guidelines. However accessibility issues can be introduced if the design system is misused, misunderstood or not implemented correctly, by many disciplines within a team such as content, design or development.


## How to use this site
This site contains several accessibility issues. The idea is to find as many of them as you can in a set period of time.

There is an accompanying worksheet and an answer sheet.


## How to run this site locally
This site is built using the <a href="http://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs">NHS.UK prototype kit</a>.

To run it locally:
- clone this repository or download it as a zip
- at a command line, enter the directory and then run `npm install`
- run `npm run watch`

The site should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`


## Thanks
This testing site is inspired by the <a href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2020/01/14/training-people-to-do-accessibility-reviews/">'Training people to do accessibility reviews'</a> blog article by Beverley Newing at the Ministry of Justice. This site is based on the <a href="https://record-a-goose-sighting.herokuapp.com/">'Record a goose sighting'</a> fictional service she created.
